# Customer Segmentation Analysis
## Algorithm used: K Means Clustering 
I am using the mall_customers dataset from Kaggle. It has some basic data like the Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score, which is automatically assigned to the customer based on the defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data. 

This dataset is composed by the following five features:

CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to the customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Annual Income: Annual Income of the customer
Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.
